## Open-source Music Player made by me and further enhancements are going on!

### ðŸŽ¶ Why I Created RD_Music_Player

Iâ€™ve always turned to music â€” whether to focus, heal, or just feel something real in a noisy world.

But over time, even music started feeling... interrupted.  
Every few songs, an ad. A push for a subscription. A moment lost.

I didnâ€™t want much â€” just a space to listen freely.  
No ads. No noise. Just the music.

So one day, I decided to build it myself.  
Thatâ€™s how **RD_Music_Player** was born.

Made with Flutter, built from the heart â€” itâ€™s clean, cross-platform, and completely ad-free.  
Not to compete, but to care. For people like me, who just want their music â€” uninterrupted.

Itâ€™s open-source because I believe good things should be shared.  
And maybe, somewhere out there, someone needs this just as much as I did.
